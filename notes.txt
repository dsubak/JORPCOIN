PROCESS FUNCTION TODOS:
- TODO: per advice at https://github.com/jsvine/markovify get texts cleaned up such that they are either newline or period seperated
  - Probably the latter; possible to just remove all newline characters?
  - Nix control characters as well - there are a lot in the Buterin paper
- TODO: Need to rule out Table of Contents, References, Images/diagrams (if possible), page numbers
- TODO: Any sane ideas for how to address footnote/endnote references? Suspect they'll pollute the corpus.
- TODO: Two column PDFs might be a special case
  - TODO: How can I detect this programmatically?


LOW PRIORITY:
- TODO: Replace urlretrieve usage w/ requests so we can add a sane timeout
